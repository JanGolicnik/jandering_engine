# Jandering engine

This is a simple "engine" I'd like to use to make my Rust project in. I'm trying to give myself as much flexibility as possible while also having a reasonably clean API. I've not delved into rendering performance using indirect buffers and such much so I can't really call it a particulary fast rendering framework, but I do find it fun to use.
