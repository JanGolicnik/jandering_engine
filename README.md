# Jandering engine

This is a simple rendering engine I made as both a learning project and hopefully something I can use for all my further graphics programming endeavors. I want the engine to be super bare bones, as to not limit me when I want to do something obscure, but still simple enough where it doesnt take more than a few lines of code to get a pleasing result.
